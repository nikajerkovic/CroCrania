# CroCrania
CroCrania is an app for estimating the sex of unidentified skulls developed and validated using MSCT images of the modern Croatian population. It is available at https://crocrania.onrender.com/. 
The app was created with Flask (3.0.2), a Python web framework, for the backend and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend. It utilizes Pandas (2.2.0) for managing data from files and NumPy (1.26.3) for array operations. Currently in its beta version, the app invites users to test its functionalities, with the potential for further improvements and features in future updates.
